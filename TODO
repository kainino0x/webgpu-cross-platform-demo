Flaky alignfault on `new WGPUTextureImpl` and similar, fixed locally by adding
a member `int x = 0` to WGPUTextureImpl but then the problem moves to TextureViewImpl.
Adding that to all "PASSTHROUGH" objects doesn't work (then fails in Texture).

ASan use-after-free errors, trying to release a Buffer after it's been released already?
This is happening on shutdown due to destruction of static objects in particular.

Release build crashes with "memory access out of bounds" (before even rendering anything),
not sure if fixing ASan build will fix this
