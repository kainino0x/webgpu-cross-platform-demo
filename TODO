Flaky alignfault on `new WGPUTextureImpl` and similar
This goes away if I add a member `int x = 0` to WGPUTextureImpl but then the
problem moves to TextureViewImpl.
Adding that to all "PASSTHROUGH" objects doesn't work (then it just fails in Texture again).
ASan seems to progress past this point so it might not catch it.

ASan use-after-free errors
The destructor of (at least one of) the static variables runs more than once.
(It seems to run _5 times_ in fact.)
Initially it was on readbackBuffer, which I made non-static, then it moved to
others.

Release build crashes with "memory access out of bounds" (before even rendering anything),
not sure if fixing ASan build will fix this

Switch to stackSave/stackRestore, see https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/pull/21764
(As a bonus this _may_ fix the "depends on internal symbol" warning, but it doesn't really matter.)
